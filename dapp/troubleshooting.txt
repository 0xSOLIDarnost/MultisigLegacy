Since this is a legacy project, sometimes something may go wrong.
Just in case this happens, I made an archive with node_modules folder.
What you should do is:
1. Delete your node_modules folder
2. Unpack the archive to the /dapp folder
3. Make sure you're using latest node version
4. Run "grunt" from the /dapp folder
